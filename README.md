I have been programming for long but never really committed to version control and Git, simply because I didn't need it as I wasn't building serious software. Just snippets that did cool stuff I wanted to do. You'll mostly see random pieces of mathematical transforms, a lot of signal processing snippets for the most part. This is totally undocumented and pre-ChatGPT for most of it so hope to find a lot of 'amateur' code within.
